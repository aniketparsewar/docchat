"""The RAG pipeline: retrieve the best chunks, then generate a cited answer.

Flow: question -> embed -> cosine search -> top-k chunks -> prompt with
numbered excerpts -> LLM answers citing [1], [2], ...

The min_score guard is a refusal mechanism: if even the best chunk is
dissimilar to the question, the document probably doesn't contain the
answer, and we say so instead of letting the model improvise.

Hybrid retrieval (hybrid=True) fuses vector similarity with keyword overlap
via Reciprocal Rank Fusion: chunks that match exact terms (e.g. "AMAZON.CA")
get a boost even when the embedding finds them only mildly similar. Unlike
a hard keyword pre-filter, fusion never vetoes — a paraphrased question with
no term overlap gracefully degrades to pure vector search.
