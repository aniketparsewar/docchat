"""Split text into overlapping token windows.

Why chunk at all? Two reasons:
1. Embedding models have input limits, and one giant vector for a whole
   document is a blurry summary — retrieval needs focused units.
2. The LLM's context window is finite — we can only afford to send the
   most relevant chunks, not the whole document.

Overlap exists so a sentence split across a boundary still appears whole
in at least one chunk.

Two strategies:
- chunk_text: fixed token windows (fast, but can cut mid-sentence/row).
- chunk_paragraphs: split into structural blocks first (blank lines and
  headings), then pack whole blocks into token windows. A boundary never
  lands mid-line, so tables and definitions stay intact.
